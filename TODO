Features
- add random_foo method to record for randomly generating content
- randomly fill every column if no block is passed to populate
- add "words" method to generate a number of words
- limit number of queries per insert

Possible
- iterate through array instead of selecting at random to ensure all values are chosen
- if hash is passed, apply given value that number of times: { 'foo' => 3, 'bar' => 2 }
- add "sentences" method to generate a number of sentences

Performance
- ruby-prof to see where the bottlenecks are
- benchmark to find faster solutions
- ensure instatiating the model is really that much of a performance hit.
- don't use an insert for every nested factory - do it all at once at the end

Support Environments
- sqlite 2
- old rails
- edge rails
