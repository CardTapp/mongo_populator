Features
- get single table inheritance working.

Possible
- iterate through array instead of selecting at random to ensure all values are chosen
- if hash is passed, apply given value that number of times: { 'foo' => 3, 'bar' => 2 }
- randomly fill every column if no block is passed to populate
- add random_foo method to record for randomly generating content

Performance
- ruby-prof to see where the bottlenecks are
- benchmark to find faster solutions
- ensure instantiating the model is really that much of a performance hit.

Support Environments
- sqlite 2
- old rails
- edge rails

Tests
- automatically detect schema changes and rebuild database
- add db:reset, db:drop and db:create rake tasks
