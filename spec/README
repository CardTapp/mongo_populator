Running Populator Specs
-----------------------

There are several rake tasks for running the specs.

  rake spec             # Run specs under all databases
  rake spec:mysql       # Run specs under mysql
  rake spec:sqlite3     # Run specs under sqlite3
  ...

To run the specs under mysql you have to create the database and user.
See spec/database.yml for specifics.

  CREATE DATABASE populator_test;
  GRANT ALL ON populator_test.* TO populator@localhost;
